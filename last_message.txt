yes 1st july Ocean and Agix to be merged with Fet and then a mainnet upgrade for Fet and rebrand to ASI.  ASI will still essentially be the FET network.  Ocean and Agix will be converted at a predesignated rate to Fetch tokens.  Not all exchanges are actively supporting the merge which has the likely cause for the fluctuation and people aren't fully understanding whats happening.  Coinbase came out and said it was specifically not supporting the mrege on its exchange which seemed to time with the drop in Fet price.  If the merge goes well then it should settle down.
